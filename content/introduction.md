## Introduction

Fueled by the need for more sustainable transportation, users can pick between more forms of transport than ever before â€“ and they expect that route planners can help them combine them to find the ideal journey. Such route planners integrate various kinds of data such as road networks and schedule-based public transit. In this paper we focus on the link between the two, specifically how to walk between stops.

Computing these paths dynamically is often [too slow in practice](cite:cites delling2013computing, wagner2017public) while computing them before-hand quickly becomes [prohibitive in practice](cite:cites transfer-patterns, delling2014round, dibbelt2018connection). A single regional bus service with 40,000 stops would already yield 1.6 billion pairs of stops. These scaling issues are often neglected by only evaluating algorithms on [small unconnected footpath graphs](cite:cites wagner2017public). This restricts the amount of walking in a journey and has a [significant impact on travel times](cite:cites wagner2017public). On top of that, determining which stops to add to the same graph operates on a closed-world assumption, which makes it impractical to add additional public transit services.

Our goal is to find a way to compute and publish these footpaths in a scalable and decentralized manner. This implies that we cannot publish all the paths, but the ones that are should allow for unrestricted walking. In practice this means that every stop in the footpath graph must be reachable from every other stop if there is a path between those stops in the real world. Various actors should be able to add information to this footpath graph, and adding a new service should not require that the existing information gets changed. These actors would need a common frame of reference to combine their efforts, which can be provided by the semantic web.
