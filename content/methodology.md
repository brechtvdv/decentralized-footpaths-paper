We use a Delaunay triangulation of the public transit stop locations. The triangle edges represent footpaths that need to be computed. A road network route planner is then used to compute the actual path lengths. For practical reasons, the triangulation itself uses the Euclidean distance between stops instead of the walking distance. We lose the theoretical guarantees of the Delaunay triangulation because of this, and empirical tests are required to verify that the end result is indeed useful. 

The paths between stops of a single operator can be calculated independently from the rest. Combining the graphs of two operators is done by comparing their individual triangulations to the triangulation of their combined stops â€“ and computing the missing footpaths. This process is illustrated in Fig. 1 where the graph of a city's public transit network is merged with the one from the region around it. The combined graph is the union of each operators' graph with the additional edges that connect the two graphs. Operators typically have their own service area, which means that the vast majority of paths will be between stops of the same operator. Thus making it possible for anyone to combine several operators' graphs with minimal work. And just as important: the results can be shared and reused, which stands in stark contrast to the conventional approaches. The paths can be published similar to the Routable Tiles dataset so that sharing them doesn't come at a significant extra cost.
